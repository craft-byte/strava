            In Strava there can be 4 roles in restaurant: owner, waiter, cook, manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            Owner is the person that created the restaurant. Owner can do anything he wants with the restaurant: change settings, change dishes, add staff, remove staff and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Waiter and cook are staff added to your restaurant by owner or managers. Waiter and cook are only allowed on corresponding pages. Cook can only cook dishes, waiter can serve dishes, and add orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manager is person that can change only allowed by the owner things, for example, owner can give a manager ability to change dishes. Owner can also give managers ability to do the same things as waiter, cook, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strava has 3 staff modes you can choose: disabled, solo, standart.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="title-font">
                Disabled mode
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If want just add orders for statistics to Strava choose disabled mode. Customers won't be able to order in your restaurant on their device. Orders must be added manually by your staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="title-font">
                Standart mode
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want everybody of your staff to work on separate device choose strandart mode. With standart mode you have to add to each registered staff member to the restaurant and give them a role on staff page.
        </p>
        <p>Each person will see things they'll need on their devices: cooks will see ordered dishes that have to bee cooked, waiters will see cooked dishes that have to be served, and if waiters are allowed they also can add orders manually. Managers with cook and waiter ability will see hybrid page where they'll see dishes to be cooked and dishes to be served.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="title-font">
                Solo mode
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want everything (cook content and waiter content) to be on one device (like manager with cook and waiter roles) choose solo mode.
        </p>
